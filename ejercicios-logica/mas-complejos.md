1. Anagrams 
An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse. 
Implement a function def anagrams(word, possible_anagrams) that receives 2 parameters: a string( word ) and an array of strings( possible_anagrams ); and returns an array with all the anagrams for that word. 
For example: Given 'horse' and ['heros', 'horse', 'shore', 'standard'] as arguments, the output should be: ['heros', 'horse', 'shore'] 

2. Frog Jump 
A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D. Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target. 
Write a function def frog_jump(x, y, d) that, given three integers X , Y and D , returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y . 
For example: Given: X = 10 , Y = 85 and D = 30 , the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows: 
* After the first jump, at position 40 (10 + 30) 
* After the second jump, at position 70 (10 + 30 + 30) 
* After the third jump, at position 100 (10 + 30 + 30 + 30) 
Assume that: X , Y and D are integers within the range (1..1,000,000,000) and X â‰¤ Y . 

3. Department Salaries 
You are given two tables, department and employee , with the following structure: 

create table department ( dept_id integer not null, dept_name varchar(30) not null, 
dept_location varchar(30) not null, 
unique(dept_id) ); 
create table employee ( 
emp_id integer not null, emp_name varchar(50) not null, 
dept_id integer not null, salary integer not null, unique(emp_id) ); 

Each record in the table department represents a department which might hire some employees. Each record in the table employee represents an employee who works for one of the departments from the table department. 
Write an SQL query that returns a table comprising all the departments ( dept_id ) in the table department that hire at least one employee, the number of people they employ and the sum of salaries in each department. The table should be ordered by dept_id (in increasing order). 
For example: 

Department Table: 
dept_id dept_name dept_location 
10 Accounts Delhi 
20 Marketing Delhi 
30 Production Hyderabad 
40 IT Warsaw 
50 Sales Bengaluru 
Employee Table: 
emp_id emp_name dept_id salary 
1 Jojo 20 5000 
2 Popat Lal 30 15000 
3 Santa Singh 40 25000 
4 Banta Singh 20 7500 
5 Sohan Lal 20 15000 
6 Kk 10 12000 
7 Bob 20 35000 
8 John 30 25000 
9 Smith 40 5000 
Your query should return: 
dept_id count sum_of_salary 
10 1 12000 
20 4 62500 
30 2 40000 
40 2 30000 

4. It's Saturday, the night is coming and Ariel knows it. Today is the day that he will finally perform "The Golden Mile": a challenge where he has to drink a beer in each of the best 20 breweries in Buenos Aires City. But such an epic challenge does not combine well with driving a car, so he wants to make sure not to being involved in a car crash again. Therefore, your mission will be: 
a) Write an algorithm that finds the optimal path for Ariel to reach all the breweries, plus, find out the amount of time that it would take him to do so. 
b) Explain what criteria you used to consider that the path is optimal (and anything else you think is important to clarify about the algorithm). 
Some clarifications: 
* The location of the 20 breweries in a json is attached in separated file. 
* Consider a constant speed of 60 km / h for Ariel's car, and ignore the time he spends at each brewery. 
* Consider as if the distance between brewery and brewery is Euclidean, that is, the road is a straight line. 
* You can define in advance the brewery where the challenge will start, but the rest of the route must be found by your algorithm.
