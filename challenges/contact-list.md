### Contacts List View
* The contacts should be grouped into two sections: Favorite Contacts and Other Contacts. Within each section, they should be sorted alphabetically by name.
* Each cell should display the associated contact’s small image. Use the included
small placeholder image when appropriate.
   * If a contact is a favorite, display a star emoji (⭐ ) in front of their name. The emoji might look different depending on your platform.
 * Tapping on a contact should take the user to the detail page for that contact.
### Contact Detail View
 * Display the contact’s large image on this page. Use the included large placeholder image when appropriate.
* If the contact does not have a particular piece of information, that row should not appear on their detail page.
* In the top right corner, display a button that allows the user to favorite and unfavorite a contact.
* When the user favorites or unfavorites a contact, the home page should be updated to reflect that change.
Other Notes
 * Your app should be responsive to all screen sizes (phone, tablet, desktop). You should support a minimum width of 320 and a maximum width of 1024.
* You do not need to persist data between sessions.
* Use of libraries and frameworks is optional, but if you decide to use a single page
application framework, we ask that you use one of the following: Angular, AngularJS,
React or Vue.
* Make sure that all dependencies are saved within the package.json file.
